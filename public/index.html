      // UseReducer(Redux): React's useState hook can get you a really long way with React state management.
      // That said, sometimes you want to separate the state logic from the components that make the state changes.
      // In addition, if you have multiple elements of state that typically change together,
      // then having an object that contains those elements of state can be quite helpful.

      // One important thing to note here is that the reducer (called nameReducer above) is called with two arguments:
      //
      // 1.the current state
      // 2.whatever it is that the dispatch function (called setName above) is called with. This is often called an "action."

        return newName
